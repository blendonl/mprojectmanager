## Development

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- React hooks for state management

### Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer:** Pure business entities
- **Service Layer:** Business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer:** External dependencies
- **UI Layer:** React Native components

Dependency Injection is used throughout for testability.

### Adding New Features

1. Create entities in `domain/entities/`
2. Define service methods in `services/`
3. Implement UI in `ui/screens/` or `ui/components/`
4. Write tests for all layers
5. Update this README

## Compatibility

### Python Desktop Version

This mobile app uses the same markdown file format as the Python desktop version (MKanban TUI). You can:

- ✅ Create boards on mobile, edit on desktop
- ✅ Create tasks on desktop, view on mobile
- ✅ Use both simultaneously with file sync
- ✅ Switch between platforms seamlessly

### File Format

**Board File (board.md):**
```yaml
---
id: my-project
name: My Project
description: Project description
parents:
  - id: feature-x
    name: Feature X
    color: blue
    created_at: 2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z
created_at: 2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z
---

# My Project
```

**Item File (MKA-1-task-name.md):**
```yaml
---
id: MKA-1
title: Fix bug
parent_id: feature-x
metadata:
  issue_type: Bug
created_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z

```

## Performance

- **Virtualized Lists:** FlatList for smooth scrolling with 1000+ items
- **Memoization:** React.memo on all list components
- **Lazy Loading:** Load boards on demand
- **Debounced Operations:** File watcher with 3-second polling

## Troubleshooting

# Clear cache and restart
expo start -c
```

### Tests Failing

```bash
# Clear Jest cache
npm test -- --clearCache
```

### File Sync Issues
